TA Questions:

1. How do we go about citing outside code (for example, using a pre-made d3 US map canvas for a heat map)?

2.  Going off of the last question, how/where do we cite our data source?

3. How elaborate (in terms of CSS) does our final page need to be? Should there be sufficient styling?
